Java 2D tile-based platformer game
**************************************************

A simple game similar to the Super Marios, where the player can jump, run, attack, collect items, start from one side of the game
and reach the other end to finish the level.

I developed this game in Eclipse to practice my Java skills, learned a few things from here and there and spent about two weeks
to finish this game. I had a fun time making this project, at the beginning I just wanted to make a really simple game but as I 
progressed, I kept having new ideas, such as I should have some items in the game or I should show a little statistics of the 
player when the game is finished, it took me some time to look at the design again and again to finally add in all those features.

I wanted to make the game as fun as possible (even though there's only one level to show) and also l tried to make it look as nice as
possible, spent a lot of time adjusting those animations and redid those images. The ImageLoader class and Assets class make this
project not optimally oop, but I did it for the convenience.

These are pretty much all I want to say about this project, I'm just happy it is done.
